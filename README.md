## Graphs: 
#### Minimum Spanning Tree
* [Kruskal's Algorithm](https://github.com/KhushiPrerak/Algorithms/blob/master/Kruskal's%20Algorithm.cpp)
  > Union Find |
  > Time: O(ElogV)
#### Shortest Path
* [Bellman Ford Algorithm](https://github.com/KhushiPrerak/Algorithms/blob/master/Bellman%20Ford.cpp)
  > Single source shortest path and Negative weight cycle detection |
  > Time: O(E*V) 
* [Floyd Warshall Algorithm](https://github.com/KhushiPrerak/Algorithms/blob/master/Floyd%20Warshall.cpp)
  > All pair shortest path in a weighted directed graph |
  > Time: O(V<sup>3</sup>)
  
 ## Heaps 
 ### [Binary Heap](https://github.com/KhushiPrerak/Algorithms/blob/master/Min%20Heap.cpp)
 A Binary Heap is a Complete Binary Tree. It is typically represented as an array.
 For a Min Heap, the following operations are possible : 
   * **getMin()**
     > Returns the root element of Min Heap <br />
     > Time Complexity: O(1)
    
   * **removeMin()**
     > Removes the minimum element from MinHeap <br />
     > Time Complexity: O(Logn) 
   * **decreaseKey()**
     > Decreases value of key at index i <br />
     > Time Complexity: O(Logn)
   * **insertKey()**
     > Add a new key at the end of the tree and Heapify <br />
     > Time Complexity: O(Logn)
   * **deleteKey()**
     > Delete element at index i <br />
     > Time Complexity: O(Logn)
